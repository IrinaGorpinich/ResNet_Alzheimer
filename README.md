#        RESEARCH AND SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEURAL NETWORK TOOLS FOR MRI-BASED DIAGNOSING OF ALZHEIMER`S DISEASE

**Gorpinich Iryna, Subbotin Serhii**

The object of research is the process of computational diagnosis of dementia, driven by data based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain patients.
The subject of the research is methods and tools for automated diagnosis of the stages of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI images based on deep neural networks.
The purpose of the work is the develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a neural network model for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease in order to increase the classification accuracy to 90% on the test sample. 
Materials, methods and technical means: Python programming language, PyCharm development environment.
Results - a model based on ResNet50 with self-reinforced attention mechanism was created, which demonstrated high accuracy in classifying dementia stages; mechanisms for dynamic class balancing and learning on difficult samples (Hard Simple Mining) were implemented.
Practical value – the developed model can be integrated into medical diagnostic systems for automatic analysis of MRI images, helping doctors detect and monitor the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
Conclusions – the use of pre-trained models with mechanisms of self-reinforced attention and adaptive class balancing allows to increase the accuracy of dementia diagnosis; further studies may include expanding the sample and applying other neural network architectures.
